## Project Description

### 1.1 Purpose
The **Student Grade Management System (SRS)** is a console-based application designed to define and implement the requirements for managing student records and grades. This project serves as a practical tool for students to enhance their understanding of fundamental programming concepts in C, including variables, if conditions, loops, functions, structs, and pointers. By developing this system, the programmer aims to create an efficient solution for handling student data while reinforcing core programming skills.

### 1.2 Scope
The application provides a user-friendly interface to perform the following functionalities:
- Add and update student records (e.g., name, ID, scores).
- Calculate grades based on input scores.
- Display summaries, including:
  - Highest score in the class.
  - Average score across all students.
  - List of students who passed or failed based on a predefined threshold.
  
The system leverages programming logic to process data efficiently, offering a hands-on approach to learning and applying C programming techniques.

## Skills and Deliverables

### Skills Utilized
- **C Programming:** Core language used to implement the system logic, data structures, and algorithms.
- **Database:** Basic data management using structs and arrays to store student records.
- **File Management:** Capability to save and retrieve student data from files for persistence.
- **Menu Design:** Intuitive console-based menu system for user interaction.
- **Microsoft Visual Studio:** Development environment used for coding, debugging, and testing.

### Deliverables
- Source code files written in C.
- A fully functional console application.
- Documentation (this README and inline code comments).
- Sample input/output demonstrations for testing.
